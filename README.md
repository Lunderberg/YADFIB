Yet Another Dwarf Fortress In Browser
=====================================

This is intended as a way to play shared sessions of Dwarf Fortress in a browser.
(From the title, I'm not sure what else you would expect.)

To run, this expects a linux environment with `ssh-keygen`, `git`, and `virtualenv` available.

This was developed over a few hours, and so bugs and security holes likely abound.
I have tried to avoid any obvious security holes,
  but I am not an expert and take no responsibility.
Use at your own risk.
